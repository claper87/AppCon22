# Preparing to work with the OrderService

Alright! You've made it to the last part of this first module. Your last exercise is going to set you up for success to start working with the OrderService class.

Remember what a service is?
__A Service Class knows how to execute actions given an object wrapper or a search request instance.__

In this last exercise, you will create a new class called `OrderController` which will be the basis of our next adventure.

## Now is your turn to practice

1. Go to https://bit.ly/3thLsjv
2. Copy the code shown
3. Using the developer console (or your preferred IDE), create the ItemController class
4. Paste the code & complete the to-dos.
